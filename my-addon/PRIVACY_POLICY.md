Pixel Pluck — Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 18, 2026

1. Introduction

Pixel Pluck ("we", "us", "our") provides an Adobe Express add-on that helps extract brand information, generate design prompts, and audit designs. This Privacy Policy explains what information the add-on collects, how it is used, and your choices.

2. Data We Collect

- Local storage: The add-on stores user preferences locally using the Add-on UI SDK `clientStorage` (for example, language preferences and the optional Groq API key entered by the user). The Groq API key is stored client-side in the user's Add-on storage and is not included in the distributed package.

- Content provided by you: When you paste text, upload an image, or enter a URL for brand analysis you are providing content that is used to generate AI outputs. This content is sent to the configured Groq API (or other configured services) to perform analysis. You should not supply sensitive personal data.

- No automatic telemetry: The add-on does not collect analytics or telemetry data by default. If analytics or error reporting is added later it will be disclosed and opt-in where feasible.

3. Third-Party Services

- AI Services: If you enter a Groq API key in Settings, AI calls (brand extraction, vision analysis, prompt generation) are made directly to the Groq service using that key. We do not ship a Groq API key; you must provide your own. The use of Groq is subject to Groq's privacy policy and terms.

- Proxies: For website scraping the add-on may use public CORS proxies. Avoid sending sensitive data via public proxies.

4. How We Use Your Data

- To provide add-on features: Content you provide is used to perform brand extraction, image analysis, and prompt generation as requested.
- To store preferences: Language settings, and the optional Groq API key, are stored in the add-on's `clientStorage` on your account.

5. Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell or otherwise share your content or personal data except as required to provide the functionality you request (for example, sending data to Groq if you configured a Groq key). We may disclose information to comply with law or to protect rights.

6. Security

We follow reasonable practices to protect stored data in the client environment. You are responsible for keeping your own API keys and account secure. Do not enter API keys you do not trust.

7. Retention

Data stored in `clientStorage` remains associated with your add-on instance. To remove stored keys/preferences, use the Settings screen to clear them.

8. Children's Privacy

This add-on is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

9. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. We will update the date at the top when we do.
